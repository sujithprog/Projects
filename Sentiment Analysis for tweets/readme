3-Way Sentiment Analysis for Tweets
Project Overview
This project applies sentiment analysis to tweets, categorizing them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the analysis aims to gauge public sentiment on various topics, demonstrating the power of data science in extracting meaningful insights from social media data.

Objective
The main goal is to develop an NLP model capable of accurately classifying tweets by sentiment. This tool can help businesses and researchers understand public opinion, track sentiment trends over time, and make data-driven decisions.

Methodology
Data Collection: Collected tweets using the Twitter API, focusing on specific keywords, hashtags, or user accounts to gather a diverse dataset.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocessed the text data by cleaning, tokenizing, and applying techniques like stemming or lemmatization to prepare for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of sentiments within the dataset and identify common patterns or keywords associated with each sentiment.
Model Development: Implemented and trained NLP models, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or LSTM networks, to classify tweets by sentiment.
Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Optimized the models through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language for the project.
Tweepy: For accessing the Twitter API and collecting tweets.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.
NLTK or spaCy: For natural language processing tasks.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation.
TensorFlow or Keras: For building and training deep learning models.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualization of data and analysis results.

Key Findings
Identified the most common words and phrases associated with each sentiment category.
Analyzed sentiment distribution across different topics, revealing public opinion trends.

Results are as follows:
 -Logistic Regression V2 (with polarity scores) Accuracy:50.7%
 -Logistic Regression classifier                Accuracy:49.3%
 -Decision Tree classifier                      Accuracy:48.7%
 -Dummy Classifier                              Accuracy:42%
