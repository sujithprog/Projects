*Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks*
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the stock market performance of major tech companies over the past year. By examining various metrics such as stock prices (opening, closing, high, low), volume traded, and stock volatility, the project provides insights into the tech sector's behavior and its financial health.

Objective
The primary objective is to understand the trends and patterns in the stock performance of leading tech companies, identifying potential investment opportunities and assessing the sector's overall stability and growth prospects.

Methodology
Data Collection: Utilized financial APIs or public datasets to retrieve historical stock data for selected tech companies over the last year.
Data Preprocessing: Prepared the data for analysis by handling missing values, converting data types, and creating a structured dataset conducive to exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough investigation of the dataset to summarize its main characteristics, often visualizing them in the process. Key metrics analyzed include stock prices (minimum, maximum, average) and trading volumes.
Advanced Analysis: Performed more in-depth analyses such as calculating stock price volatility, comparing stock performance across different companies, and identifying trends that could inform investment decisions.
Visualization: Created visual representations of the data and analysis findings to facilitate understanding of complex relationships and trends within the stock market data.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Primary programming language used for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical calculations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating static, interactive, and informative visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process, making it reproducible and accessible.
Key Findings
