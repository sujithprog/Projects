# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sujithprog/Projects/tree/main/Boston%20housing%20Analysis%20Project): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical 
           analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
   	- [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection](https://github.com/sujithprog/Projects/tree/main/Diabetic%20retinopathy%20detection): Developed an automated system for detecting Diabetic Retinopathy in retinal images using deep learning 
          techniques. The project involved image preprocessing, model training using convolutional neural networks, and evaluation of model performance to assist in early diagnosis.
